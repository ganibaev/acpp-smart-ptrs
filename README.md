# Smart pointers
Implementation of smart pointers (unique_ptr, shared_ptr) with support of custom destructors (in UniquePtr) and make_shared with one allocation (in SharedPtr). The project was made as part of the Advanced C++ course at the CS program of Higher School of Economics.

SharedPtr also implements a framework to support WeakPtr.
